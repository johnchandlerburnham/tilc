This is a workthrough of a short paper introducing the Lambda Calculus by Raul
Rojas. A link to the paper is [here](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf).

I found this paper as a follow-up resource listed in Chapter 1 of Haskell
Programming from First Principle by Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki, my
notes for which can be found here: [Notes: Haskell Programming From
First Principles, Allen & Moronuki](/notes/hpfp/00)

Please note that I am using the `\ ` character to indicate &lambda;. This
is partially so that my notation is closer to Haskell, and partially so I don't
have to write `&lambda` all the time in the Markdown file this page is being
generated from. In my first draft of these notes I actually wrote everything in
LaTex (using [MathJax](www.mathjax.org) to display it on the page). Despite how
great LaTex is (and MathJax!), this was a huge mistake as it proved to be
horrifically labor-intensive. So all the pseudocode in these notes are
just going to be in ascii.
